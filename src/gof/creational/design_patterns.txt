Gang of Four (GOF)
In 1994, (4) authors:
1. Erich Gamma,
2. Richard Helm,
3. Ralph Johnson and
4. John Vlissides
They published a book titled "Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"
These authors are collectively known as Gang of Four (GOF).

Design Patterns are primarily based on the following principles of object orientated design:
    - Program to an interface not an implementation
    - Favor object composition over inheritance

1	Creational Patterns
        These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic,
        rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. This gives program more
        flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.
2	Structural Patterns
        These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is
        used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.
3	Behavioral Patterns
        These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.
4	J2EE Patterns
        These design patterns are specifically concerned with the presentation tier.
        These patterns are identified by Sun Java Center.
