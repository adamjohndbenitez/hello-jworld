/**
 * Synchronization is built around an internal entity known as the intrinsic lock or monitor lock.
 * (The API specification often refers to this entity simply as a "monitor.")
 * Intrinsic locks play a role in both aspects of synchronization:
 *  - enforcing exclusive access to an object's state.
 *  - establishing happens-before relationships that are essential to visibility.
 *
 * Implicit Locks and Synchronization describes a more general synchronization idiom,
 * and describes how synchronization is based on implicit locks.
 *
 * Every object has an intrinsic lock associated with it.
 * By convention, a thread that needs exclusive and consistent access to an object's fields
 * has to acquire the object's intrinsic lock before accessing them, and then release the
 * intrinsic lock when it's done with them.
 *
 * A thread is said to own the intrinsic lock between the time it has acquired the lock and
 * released the lock. As long as a thread owns an intrinsic lock, no other thread can acquire the same lock.
 * The other thread will block when it attempts to acquire the lock.
 *
 * When a thread releases an intrinsic lock, a happens-before relationship is established
 * between that action and any subsequent acquisition of the same lock.
 *
 * Locks In Synchronized Methods:
 * When a thread invokes a synchronized method, it automatically acquires the intrinsic lock
 * for that method's object and releases it when the method returns.
 * The lock release occurs even if the return was caused by an uncaught exception.
 * NOTE:
 * You might wonder what happens when a static synchronized method is invoked,
 * since a static method is associated with a class, not an object.
 * In this case, the thread acquires the intrinsic lock for the Class object associated with the class.
 * Thus access to class's static fields is controlled by a lock
 * that's distinct from the lock for any instance of the class.

/**
 * Synchronized statements are also useful for improving concurrency with fine-grained synchronization.
 *
 * Suppose, for example, class MsLunch has two instance fields, c1 and c2, that are never used together.
 * All updates of these fields must be synchronized,
 * but there's no reason to prevent an update of c1 from being interleaved with an update of c2 — and
 * doing so reduces concurrency by creating unnecessary blocking.
 * Instead of using synchronized methods or otherwise using the lock associated with this,
 * we create two objects solely to provide locks.
 *
 * NOTE: Use this idiom with extreme care. You must be absolutely sure that it
 * really is safe to interleave access of the affected fields.

/*
Reentrant Synchronization:

Recall that a thread cannot acquire a lock owned by another thread.
But a thread can acquire a lock that it already owns.
Allowing a thread to acquire the same lock more than once enables reentrant synchronization.
This describes a situation where synchronized code, directly or indirectly,
invokes a method that also contains synchronized code, and both sets of code use the same lock.
Without reentrant synchronization, synchronized code would have to take many
additional precautions to avoid having a thread cause itself to block.
