A concurrent application's ability to execute in a timely manner is known as its liveness.
This section describes the most common kind of liveness problem:
- deadlock,
and goes on to briefly describe two other liveness problems,
- starvation and livelock.

1. deadlock - threads are both waiting for each other to response - they took forever
              cuz they both are waiting.

2. starvation - other threads frequently synchronized access to the same object will often be blocked
                shared resources are made unavailable for long periods by "greedy" threads.

livelock - making repeating progress because they both repeatedly move the same way at the same time.
